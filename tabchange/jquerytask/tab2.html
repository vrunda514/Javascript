           <h2> What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence? </h2>
            <li>Artificial neural networks and deep learning AI technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI can process large amounts of data much faster and make predictions more accurately than humanly possible.</li>

            <li>While the huge volume of data created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications using machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, a primary disadvantage of AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data AI programming requires. As AI techniques are incorporated into more products and services, organizations must also be attuned to AI's potential to create biased and discriminatory systems, intentionally or inadvertently.</li>

            <h2>Advantages of AI</h2>
                <h3>The following are some advantages of AI.</h3>
                <li>Good at detail-oriented jobs. AI has proven to be just as good, if not better than doctors at diagnosing certain cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma.</li>
                <li>AI-powered virtual agents are always available. AI programs do not need to sleep or take breaks, providing 24/7 service.</li>
                <li>Can improve customer satisfaction through personalization. AI can personalize content, messaging, ads, recommendations and websites to individual customers.</li>
            
            <h2>Disadvantages of AI</h2>
            <h3>The following are some disadvantages of AI.</h3>
            <li>Expensive.</li>
            <li>Requires deep technical expertise.</li>
            <li>Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools.</li>
            <li>Reflects the biases of its training data, at scale.</li>
            <li>Eliminates human jobs, increasing unemployment rates.</li>
